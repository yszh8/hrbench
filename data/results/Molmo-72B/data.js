These are the elongated structures at the tips of the stems that contain the plant's seeds. The racemes are numerous and clearly visible, suggesting the plant is well into its flowering and seed-producing phase.\n\nAs for the number of racemes, while it's difficult to count them precisely, there seem to be quite a few - certainly more than 10, but probably not as many as 200. Based on the description of \"many\" racemes and the appearance of the plant, I would estimate there are likely between 10 and 100 racemes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<ans>B</ans>"}, "630": {"id": "MMAD_120", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "631": {"id": "MMAD_221", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "632": {"id": "MMAD_53", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "633": {"id": "MMAD_100", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "634": {"id": "MMAD_4", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "635": {"id": "MMAD_131", "response": " <ans>D</ans>"}, "636": {"id": "MMAD_190", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "637": {"id": "MMAD_114", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "638": {"id": "MMAD_145", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "639": {"id": "MMAD_85", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "640": {"id": "MMAD_165", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "641": {"id": "MMAD_10", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "642": {"id": "MMAD_135", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "643": {"id": "MMAD_154", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "644": {"id": "MMAD_122", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "645": {"id": "MMAD_192", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "646": {"id": "MMAD_52", "response": " <ans>D</ans>"}, "647": {"id": "MMAD_74", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "648": {"id": "MMAD_70", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "649": {"id": "MMAD_253", "response": " <ans>D</ans>"}, "650": {"id": "MMAD_288", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "651": {"id": "MMAD_109", "response": " <ans>D</ans>"}, "652": {"id": "MMAD_13", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "653": {"id": "MMAD_17", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "654": {"id": "MMAD_75", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "655": {"id": "MMAD_23", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "656": {"id": "MMAD_18", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "657": {"id": "MMAD_36", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "658": {"id": "MMAD_12", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "659": {"id": "MMAD_299", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "660": {"id": "MileBench_118", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "661": {"id": "MileBench_297", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "662": {"id": "MileBench_13", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "663": {"id": "MileBench_154", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "664": {"id": "MileBench_74", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "665": {"id": "MileBench_99", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "666": {"id": "MileBench_267", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "667": {"id": "MileBench_101", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "668": {"id": "MileBench_148", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "669": {"id": "MileBench_252", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "670": {"id": "MileBench_136", "response": " <ans>D</ans>"}, "671": {"id": "MileBench_244", "response": " <ans>D</ans>"}, "672": {"id": "MileBench_271", "response": " <ans>D</ans>"}, "673": {"id": "MileBench_175", "response": " <ans>E</ans>"}, "674": {"id": "MileBench_37", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "675": {"id": "MileBench_143", "response": " <ans>D</ans>"}, "676": {"id": "MileBench_157", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "677": {"id": "MileBench_65", "response": " <ans>A</ans>"}, "678": {"id": "MileBench_27", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "679": {"id": "MileBench_259", "response": " <ans>B</ans>"}, "680": {"id": "MileBench_165", "response": " <ans>C</ans>"}, "681": {"id": "MileBench_285", "response": " The image depicts two scenes that seem to be inspired by or related to Andrew Miller's novel \"Pure\". \n\nThe left side shows a bustling cityscape, likely representing Paris in the late 18th century.
