The novel explores themes of death, progress, and the human condition, with Miller stating that he was interested in \"what happens when our sense of ourselves falls away under the pressure of circumstances. What's left?\"\n\nThe book's popularity and critical acclaim are evident from its multiple award nominations, including for the Costa Book Award 2011 for \"Best Novel\" and \"Book of the Year\".
